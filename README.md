## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned that the mobile-first approach to designing websites is very important. As the majority users on the web uses mobile devices, it makes prototyping very quick and solves many problems faster by addressing it on day 1 of designing.  

### Useful resource(s)

During this project, I read from this: 
- [Centering item with Grid](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-grid-center-element/) - This helped me centerd the card on the center of the viewport with Grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
